    "This chapter introduces the tools we need to run simulations, record the results, and plot them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used a `State` object to represent the state of the system.\n",
    "Then we used the `flip` function and an `if` statement to simulate a single time step.\n",
    "We used `for` loop to simulate a series of steps, and a `TimeSeries` to record the results.\n",
    "Finally, we used `plot` and `decorate` to plot the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, we will extend this simulation to make it a little more realistic."
