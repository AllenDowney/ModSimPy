    "\n",
    "For a small object with mass $m$, rotating around a point at distance\n",
    "$r$, the moment of inertia is $I = m r^2$. For more complex objects, we can compute $I$ by dividing the object into small masses, computing\n",
    "moments of inertia for each mass, and adding them up.\n",
