    "\n",
    "* Abstraction is the process of defining a model by deciding which elements of the real world to include and which can be left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analysis and simulation are ways to use a model to generate predictions, explain why things behave as they do, and design things that behave as we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Validation is how we test whether the model is right, often by comparing predictions with measurements from the real world.\n",
