*Modeling and Simulation in Python* is an introduction to physical modeling using a computational approach.  It is organized in three parts:

* The first part presents discrete models, including a bikeshare system and world population growth.

* The second part introduces first-order systems, including models of infectious disease, thermal systems, and pharmacokinetics.

* The third part is about second-order systems, including mechanical systems like projectiles, celestial mechanics, and rotating rigid bodies.

Taking a computational approach makes it possible to work with more realistic models than what you typically see in a first-year physics class, with the option to include features like friction and drag.

Python is an ideal programming language for this material.  It is a good first language for people who have not programmed before, and it provides high-level data structures that are well-suited to express solutions to the problems we are interested in.
