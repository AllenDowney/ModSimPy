    "In effect, the simulations assume that the derivatives $dG/dt$ and $dX/dt$ are constant during each 2Â min time step.\n",

    "Euler's method is good enough for many problems, but sometimes it is not very accurate.\n",
    "In that case, we can usually make it more accurate by decreasing the size of `dt`.\n",
    "But then it is not very efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other methods that are more accurate and more efficient than Euler's method.\n",
