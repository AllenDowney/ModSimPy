    "1.  Look up the Law of Universal Gravitation and any constants you need.  I suggest you work entirely in SI units: meters, kilograms, and Newtons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  When the distance between the Earth and the Sun gets small, this system behaves badly, so you should use an event function to stop when the surface of Earth reaches the surface of the Sun.\n",

    "3. Express your answer in days, and plot the results as millions of kilometers versus days.\n",
