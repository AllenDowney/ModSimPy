    "On the other hand, ignoring air resistance is not a good choice, because in this scenario its effect is substantial.\n",

    "This chapter introduces a modeling framework that consists of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Abstraction is the process of defining a model by deciding which elements of the real world to include and which can be left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analysis and simulation are ways to use a model to generate predictions, explain why things behave as they do, and design things that behave as we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Validation is how we test whether the model is right, often by comparing predictions with measurements from the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first example, we modeled a penny dropped from the Empire State building, including gravity but ignoring air resistance.\n",
    "In the exercises, you'll have a chance to try a better model, including air resistance.\n",
