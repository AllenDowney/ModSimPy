    "Suppose you want to set the world record for the highest \"bungee dunk\", which is a stunt in which a bungee jumper dunks a cookie in a cup of tea at the lowest point of a jump. An example is shown in this video: <http://modsimpy.com/dunk>.\n",

    "Since the record is 70 m, let's design a jump for 80 m. We'll start with the following modeling assumptions:\n",

    "-   Initially the bungee cord hangs from a crane with the attachment\n",
    "    point 80 m above a cup of tea.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Until the cord is fully extended, it applies no force to the jumper.  It turns out this might not be a good assumption; we'll revisit it in the next case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   After the cord is fully extended, it obeys Hooke's Law; that is, it applies a force to the jumper proportional to the extension of the cord beyond its resting length. See <http://modsimpy.com/hooke>.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The mass of the jumper is 75 kg.\n",

    "-   The jumper is subject to drag force so that their terminal velocity is 60 m/s.\n",
