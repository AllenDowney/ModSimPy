    "This chapter is a first step toward modeling changes in world population growth during the last 70 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used Pandas to read data from a web page and store the results in a `DataFrame`.\n",
    "From the `DataFrame` we selected two `Series` objects and used them to compute absolute and relative errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we computed average population growth and used it to build a simple model with constant annual growth.\n",
    "The model fits recent data pretty well; nevertheless, there are two reasons we should be skeptical:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is no obvious mechanism that could cause population growth to be constant from year to year. Changes in population are determined by the fraction of people who die and the fraction of people who give birth, so we expect them to depend on the current population.\n",
    "\n",
    "* According to this model, world population would keep growing at the same rate forever, and that does not seem reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter we'll consider other models that might fit the data better and make more credible predictions."
